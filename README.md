# mazeSolver
 ### In the repository you will see the second project for the "Fundamentos en Sistemas Inteligentes" subject of the Computer Science degree in the Salamanca's University
 <br>
 The project consist in doing a simple Searching System with solution, and the problem is a 6x7 maze.
 <br>
 The project has two parts, one is resolving the maze using Prolog that allow us to reach the solution using Backtracking and also reach the most efficient solution.
 <br>
 The other part is using a A* algorithm with a specific heuristic to prove that execution is better than the backtrack execution did in Prolog, we built it in Python
